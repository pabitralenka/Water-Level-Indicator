The objective of the project is to indicate the water level in a water tank. It simply turns 
on the BUZZER when water falls below a certain level or when water rises over a certain level 
or when water overflows. It also displays us the current volume of water present in the water 
tank. I have used an ARDUINO UNO (ATMEGA 328P) to detect the level of water by using an 
ULTRASONIC SENSOR (HC-SRO4) mounted at the top of the water tank.
